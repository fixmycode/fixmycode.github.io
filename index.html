				<h2><a href="http://mammut.github.io/blackbird/">Blackbird Software</a></h2>
				<span>Project Manager. March 2014, ongoing</span>
				<p>My colleagues and I formed this team to participate in the <a href="http://www.feriadesoftware.cl">XXII Software Faire</a>, an event our university holds every year to encourage students to challenge themselves in IT.</p><p>The product we're presenting on the faire is an educational tool disguised as a mobile math game for elementary school students. Some of the cool things that this projects has is real time wireless interaction between mobile devices and desktop computers, sensor data tracking and analytics.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.handband.cl/">HandBand Chile</a></h2>
				<span>Software Developer. March 2014, ongoing</span>
				<p>I started working at HandBand as part of a team of two, designing and implementing the back-end platform for a new product the company is developing. Some of the challanges are working with multiple devices in an offline environment and creating a bridge that is compatible with the company's old system.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.poc.cl/">SPF / POC</a></h2>
				<span>Software Developer. June 2012 to December 2013</span>
				<p>This was my first attempt as a student to get a job in my field, and it was a great learning experience. I was able to use my experience with open-source software to solve some of the development team's annoyances and to try new technologies to work out data synchronization problems. I worked in the front-end and in the back-end platforms, configured the software stack for the server and virtual machines and revamped the version control system (I hope they still keep it neat).</p>

				<h2>GTD Manquehue</h2>
				<span>Tech Support. June 2008 to June 2012</span>
				<p>My first job had a punch card and I had to wear a tie. No sneakers on week days. GTD is a service provider, not as big as other in my region but big enough that I was tied to my seat my entire shift answering the Internet support line for the first couple of months, then rules changed and all the support teams were merged, so I learned a lot about how TV and telephone services worked on a technical level and how they were deployed. I also learned how to deal with very stressful situations for a service provider, like an earthquake.</p>

		<h1>things I love</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/fixmycode">Road Cycling</a></h3>
				<p>I've loved bikes all my life, but I started to take cycling seriously for the past two years and I've recently taken part in some bike-advocacy groups.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://onikun.deviantart.com/">Drawing and 3D modeling</a></h3>
				<p>As a kid I used to draw a lot, and as an adult I bought a Wacom board and kept drawing. I also love to use <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> for modeling, sculpting and playing with the physics engine.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/fixmycode">Indie Games</a></h3>
				<p>I don't spend too much of my time playing games, but I like games made out of love for the craft and not for the money.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Open-Source Software</h3>
				<p>I love the movement. I've taken part in a <a href="http://misago-project.org/">couple</a> of <a href="http://ajenti.org/">projects</a> and I volunteered for <a href="http://www.flisol.info/">FLISoL</a> a couple of times.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
				<p>Although I'm a Mac user, all my servers run Linux, because is the right tool for the job. I also made my parents use Ubuntu on their laptops to improve their lifes (and save me from tech support time).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Bitcoin</h3>
				<p>I'm more of a late adopter, but I fell in love with the magical Internet money. I like trying to make people sell me stuff for some mXBT as an educational process.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Great Web Design</h3>
				<p>I just love a good markup and creatively usage of scripting and other web technologies.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Artwork, Comicbooks and Movies</h3>
				<p>I love how artists are using the Internet to create a new creative ecosystem, my <a href="http://fixmycode.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is a collection of things I have scavenged through the tubes as I try to capture that feeling.</p>

			<li>messy code</li>

	<section id="why">
		<h1>why "fixmycode"?</h1>
		<p>I bought the domain because I wanted to start a blog about best programming practices, but I was too busy at the time to do it so I redirected it to my Tumblr, then I started using it as username for a lot of services. Since it was an .me domain, I thought posting my resume here was only logical.</p>

	<section id="reach">
		<h1>how to reach me</h1>
		<p>I'm not the kind of person that publishes his contact information in a public website, so you may want to reach me through one of the many personal <a href="#personal">links</a> I provided above. If you still can't get in touch with me, we weren't ment to be... &lt;/3 I'm sorry</p>
